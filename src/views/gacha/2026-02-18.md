### Mihono Bourbon
One of the strongest Front. She has Groundwork,Concentration and Savvy.Also her unique/inherit help you to keep positions.
She has good affinity with Maruzensky,so if you like Maruzensky you should get this.
The cons are you can't use all her support cards you must use for Fronts.

### Eishin Flash
Good at medium races and have Dominator. But she's not the strongest uma so it's about oshi to pull her.

### SSR Nishino Flower
Although she has 3Wit+1Speed bonuses,its Race Bonus is 0%. This is the huge problem in Trackblazer. Even if other scenarios, it gives less skill points.
Gold skill is Determined Descent,but it's .3 accel, not .4 like other gold skills. Straight Descent is enough. Also we should have NN,FineMo,and Mr.CB for wit cards.
Therefore this card is useless.

### SSR Sakura Bakushin O
3lv skill hints for Sprint at 0LB,and guarantee Groundwork. Its unique perk is not good as Guts is buffed already.
Therefore 1 copy is enough for spark farming.
