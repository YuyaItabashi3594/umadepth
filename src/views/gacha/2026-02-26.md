### Mejiro Ardan
.45 4s -1% stamina VS .45 5s Oguri Fat : Skip if you are not her oshi.
At least she has Fast Learner event,so if you farm Fast Learner you will get good result.

### SSR Agnes Digital
Left-handed,Uma Stan,and some useful hints. Guarantee Lead the Charge!.
But Unique Perk is the massive cons: We are not playing JP uma,and we only use 3-4 type supports in a deck.
And when we still play uma till Tacker's Island,this card will be useless anyway.
If you want to make perfect sparks 0LB for Lead the Charge! to get Forward,March! spark in 40% chance.

### SR Ines Fujin
PTO/Speed Eater/Slipstream fron hints. You may get at least 1 if you pull Finemo and Narita Top Road a.k.a. SR Admire Vega.
