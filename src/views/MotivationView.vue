    <p>There are <a href="#">ma</a><a href="#">ny</a> <a href="#">gui</a><a href="#">des</a> that help your uma play experience already.</p>
    <p>However,these guides are for min-maxer and F2P.</p>
    <figure>
      <img width="400" src="@/assets/motivation/01.png" alt="Other umas are hobbies" />
      <figcaption>this is corrent infomation,but it's too brutal isn't it?</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>So I make a guide for people who want to win with their oshi,or variety of umas like me: Vodka&Daiwa,Doto&TM,Suzuka&El&Grass for example.</p>
    <p>This guide is for</p>
    <ul>
      <li>oshi gamers</li>
      <li>people want to play with many umas</li>
      <li>off-meta gamers</li>
      <li>people want to see subjective issues</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This guide is not for</p>
    <ul>
      <li>F2P: You can't make your oshi win without plenty of support cards for reinforcement.</li>
      <li>people want guarantee wins/platinus title: You can win more if you use meta-umas and make same efforts.</li>
      <li>people want to see objective issues/statistics</li>
    </ul>
